## MOVIE SUCCESS PREDICTION APPLICATION USING MACHINE LEARNING
A machine learning project to predict if a movie is going to be a blockbuster or flop. This model will predict the potential success and failure of the upcoming movies based on several attributes. Some of the criteria in calculating movie success include budget, actors, director, producer, release date, etc.I will be attempting to predict this value using the classification algorithm-logistic regression.
